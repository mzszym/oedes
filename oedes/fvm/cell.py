# Basic equations
#
# Using vertex centered finite volume method to discretize the equations.
# $\frac{du}{dt} = S + \nabla \cdot F $
# by discretized applying Gauss theorem
# $\int_V \frac{du}{dt}dV = \int_V S dV + \int_\Omega F d\Omega$
# where $V$ denotes cell volume, and $\Omega$ denotes cell boundary.
#
# In discretized geometry
# $V \frac{dc_i}{dt} = V s_i + \sum_k A_{ik} f_{k}$
# This is conveniently expressed by Equation.conservation
# $\frac{d\mathbf{c}}{dt} - \mathbf{s} - V^-1 \mathbf{A} \mathbf{f}=F_{internal}$
# where $V^-1$ is diagonal matrix of cell volumes. A is called fluxsum in the code.
#
# At boundary, values calculated by above equation are replaced by
# $b(V^-1 \mathbf{A} \mathbf{f},...)=F_{boundary}$
#
# Final residuals are given as $F_{internal}$ for internal points, and
# $F_{boundary}$ for boundary cells.
